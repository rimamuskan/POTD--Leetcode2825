Q: You are given two 0-indexed strings str1 and str2.

In an operation, you select a set of indices in str1, and for each index i in the set, increment str1[i] to the next character cyclically. That is 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on, and 'z' becomes 'a'.

Return true if it is possible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 by performing the operation at most once, and false otherwise.

Note: A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

 SOLUTION //
class Solution {
public:
    bool canMakeSubsequence(string str1, string str2) {
        int n=str1.size();
        int m=str2.size();
         int i=0 ;
          int j=0;
        for(;i<n && j<m ;i++){
            if(str1[i]==str2[j] || str1[i]+1==str2[j] ||str1[i]-25==str2[j]){
                //as its a cyclic increment so if there is one character in str1 is 'z' so in cyclically after increment it should be 'a' ,for this z-25=a
                j++;
            }

        
        }
        return j==m;
        
    }
};
